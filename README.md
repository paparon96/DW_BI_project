### Introduction
In this project we aim to collect and store data about air pollution in different cities throughout the world. Driven by the final goal of building an Early Warning System for unhealthy air pollution levels we collect data from 3 primary sources via API:

* Basic air pollution data (The World Air Quality Project, https://aqicn.org/api/)
* Basic weather data (Temperature, wind, humidity etc.)
* Traffic data (https://developer.here.com/documentation/traffic/dev_guide/topics/what-is.html)

We store the collected datasets in MongoDB on an AWS machine. We will build a predictive model once we have enough historical data. Then we will have an ETL process that gets the data from our MongoDB
